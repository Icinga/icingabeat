################### Icingabeat Configuration Example #########################

############################# Icingabeat ######################################

icingabeat:

  # Defines the Icinga API endpoint
  host: "localhost"

  # Defines the port of the API endpoint
  port: 5665

  # A user with sufficient permissions
  user: "icinga"

  # Password of the user
  password: "icinga"

  # Configure SSL verification. If `false` is configured, all server hosts
  # and certificates will be accepted. In this mode, SSL based connections are
  # susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. Use only for testing. Default is
  # `true`.
  ssl.verify: true

  # List of root certificates for HTTPS server verifications
  #ssl.certificate_authorities: ["/etc/pki/root/ca.pem"]

  ########################### Icingabeat Eventstream ##########################
  #
  # Icingabeat supports capturing of an evenstream and periodical polling of the
  # Icinga status data.

  # Decide which events to receive from the event stream.
  # The following event stream types are available:
  #
  # * CheckResult
  # * StateChange
  # * Notification
  # * AcknowledgementSet
  # * AcknowledgementCleared
  # * CommentAdded
  # * CommentRemoved
  # * DowntimeAdded
  # * DowntimeRemoved
  # * DowntimeStarted
  # * DowntimeTriggered
  #
  # To disable eventstream, leave the types empty or comment out the option
  eventstream.types:
    - CheckResult
    - StateChange

  # Event streams can be filtered by attributes using the prefix 'event.'
  #
  # Example for the CheckResult type with the exit_code set to 2:
  # filter: "event.check_result.exit_status==2"
  #
  # Example for the CheckResult type with the service matching the string
  # pattern "mysql*":
  # filter: 'match("mysql*", event.service)'
  #
  # To disable filtering set an empty string or comment out the filter option
  eventstream.filter: ""

    # Defines how fast to reconnect to the API on connection loss
  eventstream.retry_interval: 10s

  ########################### Icingabeat Statuspoller #########################
  #
  # Icingabeat can collect status information about Icinga 2 periodically. Set
  # an interval at which the status API should be called. Set to 0 to disable
  # polling.
  statuspoller.interval: 60s

#================================ General =====================================

# The name of the shipper that publishes the network data. It can be used to group
# all the transactions sent by a single shipper in the web interface.
#name:

# The tags of the shipper are included in their own field with each
# transaction published.
#tags: ["service-X", "web-tier"]

# Optional fields that you can specify to add additional information to the
# output.
#fields:
#  env: staging


#============================== Dashboards =====================================
# These settings control loading the sample dashboards to the Kibana index. Loading
# the dashboards is disabled by default and can be enabled either by setting the
# options here, or by using the `-setup` CLI flag or the `setup` command.
#setup.dashboards.enabled: false

# The URL from where to download the dashboards archive. By default this URL
# has a value which is computed based on the Beat name and version. For released
# versions, this URL points to the dashboard archive on the artifacts.elastic.co
# website.
#setup.dashboards.url:

#============================== Kibana =====================================

# Starting with Beats version 6.0.0, the dashboards are loaded via the Kibana API.
# This requires a Kibana endpoint configuration.
setup.kibana:

  # Kibana Host
  # Scheme and port can be left out and will be set to the default (http and 5601)
  # In case you specify and additional path, the scheme is required: http://localhost:5601/path
  # IPv6 addresses should always be defined as: https://[2001:db8::1]:5601
  #host: "localhost:5601"

#============================= Elastic Cloud ==================================

# These settings simplify using icingabeat with the Elastic Cloud (https://cloud.elastic.co/).

# The cloud.id setting overwrites the `output.elasticsearch.hosts` and
# `setup.kibana.host` options.
# You can find the `cloud.id` in the Elastic Cloud web UI.
#cloud.id:

# The cloud.auth setting overwrites the `output.elasticsearch.username` and
# `output.elasticsearch.password` settings. The format is `<user>:<pass>`.
#cloud.auth:

#================================ Outputs =====================================

# Configure what output to use when sending the data collected by the beat.

#-------------------------- Elasticsearch output ------------------------------
output.elasticsearch:
  # Array of hosts to connect to.
  hosts: ["localhost:9200"]

  # Optional protocol and basic auth credentials.
  #protocol: "https"
  #username: "elastic"
  #password: "changeme"

#----------------------------- Logstash output --------------------------------
#output.logstash:
  # The Logstash hosts
  #hosts: ["localhost:5044"]

  # Optional SSL. By default is off.
  # List of root certificates for HTTPS server verifications
  #ssl.certificate_authorities: ["/etc/pki/root/ca.pem"]

  # Certificate for SSL client authentication
  #ssl.certificate: "/etc/pki/client/cert.pem"

  # Client Certificate Key
  #ssl.key: "/etc/pki/client/cert.key"

#================================ Logging =====================================

# Sets log level. The default log level is info.
# Available log levels are: error, warning, info, debug
#logging.level: debug

# At debug level, you can selectively enable logging only for some components.
# To enable all selectors use ["*"]. Examples of other selectors are "beat",
# "publish", "service".
#logging.selectors: ["*"]

#============================== Xpack Monitoring ===============================
# icingabeat can export internal metrics to a central Elasticsearch monitoring
# cluster.  This requires xpack monitoring to be enabled in Elasticsearch.  The
# reporting is disabled by default.

# Set to true to enable the monitoring reporter.
#xpack.monitoring.enabled: false

# Uncomment to send the metrics to Elasticsearch. Most settings from the
# Elasticsearch output are accepted here as well. Any setting that is not set is
# automatically inherited from the Elasticsearch output configuration, so if you
# have the Elasticsearch output configured, you can simply uncomment the
# following line.
#xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch:
