############################# Icingabeat ######################################

icingabeat:

  # Defines the Icina API endpoint
  host: "localhost"

  # Defines the port of the API endpoint
  port: 5665

  # A user with sufficient permissions
  user: "icinga"

  # Password of the user
  password: "icinga"

  # Defines how fast to reconnect to the API after a connection loss
  retry_interval: 10s

  # Icingabeat supports capturing of an evenstream and periodical polling of the
  # Icinga status data.
  #
  # To disable the eventstream, comment out the whole section
  eventstream:
    # Decide which events to receive from the event stream.
    # The following event stream types are available:
    # * CheckResult
    # * StateChange
    # * Notification
    # * AcknowledgementSet
    # * AcknowledgementCleared
    # * CommentAdded (See https://github.com/Icinga/icingabeat/issues/1)
    # * CommentRemoved (See https://github.com/Icinga/icingabeat/issues/1)
    # * DowntimeAdded (See https://github.com/Icinga/icingabeat/issues/1)
    # * DowntimeRemoved (See https://github.com/Icinga/icingabeat/issues/1)
    # * DowntimeStarted (See https://github.com/Icinga/icingabeat/issues/1)
    # * DowntimeTriggered (See https://github.com/Icinga/icingabeat/issues/1)
    #
    # At least one type must be set
    types:
      - CheckResult
      - StateChange

    # Event streams can be filtered by attributes using the prefix 'event.'
    #
    # Example for the CheckResult type with the exit_code set to 2:
    # filter: "event.check_result.exit_status==2"
    #
    # Example for the CheckResult type with the service matching the string
    # pattern "mysql*":
    # filter: 'match("mysql*", event.service)'
    #
    # Comment out this line if you don't want to set a filter at all
    filter: ""
